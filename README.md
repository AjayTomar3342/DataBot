# Data Bot

This chatbot uses an NLP Model to create graphical plots based on user inputted data file and instructions. These instructions input the columns to be used for the creation of graphical plots. Additionally, this tool also does data quality check of uploaded data file along with sentiment analysis of user-inputted text.

## Description (Incomplete)

The user will update the data file (excel or csv) based on which he/she will ask questions from the Chat Bot. 
As long as these questions fall under the domain of data analysis and basic science tasks, the Chat Bot will
give plots and insights about the data as a response. The following services are available by this Chat Bot:

1.) Creation of downloadable plots as required by the end-user. 

## Architecture (Incomplete)

## Getting Started 

### Dependencies (Incomplete) 

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing (Incomplete)

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program (Incomplete)

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets     
* In order to submit instructions which will propel the ChatBot to create graphical plots, such an instruction is set as default. 
```
Please create a heatmap for Column Age, Column Id, Column 0 and Column Unnamed: 0
```
Such an instruction should contain which specific kind of graphical plot is required by the user and which columns should 
be used in the graphical plot. For simplicity, replacement of the graphical plot and the columns required should be done in
the above-mentioned dummy instruction.
